README: Web-Based Lanelet2 Visualization
Overview

This system provides a web-based visualization of a Lanelet2 map, vehicle position, and perception data using a ROS backend and a Three.js frontend. The visualization runs in a browser and displays:

Lanelet2 road geometry
Vehicle position (real or simulated)
Bus stops
Planned routes
Tracked and predicted objects

The backend (viz_browser.py) acts as a bridge between ROS and the web interface by exposing data through HTTP endpoints.

How to Run the Visualization
1. Start ROS Core

Make sure ROS is running:

roscore
2. Build and Source Workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
3. Launch the System

Run your unified launch file:

roslaunch lanelet_map_viz browser_gps.launch

This will start:

Visualization node (viz_browser.py)
GPS/pose node (or simulation)
Tracking and prediction nodes (if included)
4. Open the Web Interface

The system will automatically:

Start a local HTTP server
Open your browser to a page like:
http://localhost:<PORT>/temp.html

If it does not open automatically, check the terminal output for the port number and open it manually.

Using the Interface
Select a start and goal stop from the GUI
The system computes a route using Lanelet2
The route is drawn on the map
The vehicle will:
Either display real GPS position
Or simulate motion along the route

Additional visual layers:

Stops → selectable destinations
Route → computed path
Vehicle → current position
Kinematics → tracked + predicted objects
